## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL) (Schema can be changed while the app is in development)
```sql
-- Users (handled by Laravel auth)

-- Devotions
devotions: 
  id, user_id, title, verse_reference, verse_content, 
  devotion_text, mood, tags, is_public, featured_at,
  created_at, updated_at

-- Privacy audit trail
devotion_privacy_log:
  id, devotion_id, previous_privacy, new_privacy, 
  changed_by_user_id, changed_at

-- Verse Cache (to minimize API calls)
bible_verses: 
  id, reference, content, version (NIV), created_at

-- User Preferences
user_settings: 
  id, user_id, preferred_version, notification_time, 
  mood_tracking, default_privacy, created_at

-- Community moderation
devotion_reports:
  id, devotion_id, reported_by_user_id, reason, 
  status, reviewed_at, reviewed_by_admin_id
```

### API Integration Strategy
**Gemini API Usage:**
1. **Verse Lookup**: "Get the NIV text for [verse reference]"
2. **Devotion Assistance**: "Help write a devotion about [verse] focusing on [theme]"
3. **Mood Matching**: "Suggest 3 Bible verses for someone feeling [mood]"
4. **Validation**: "Is this a valid Bible verse reference: [input]?"

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Store frequently requested verses in PostgreSQL
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement smart API call management
- **Lazy Loading**: Load devotions progressively
- **Image Optimization**: Compress any visual content

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (4-6 weeks)
- Basic authentication and user management
- Simple devotion creation (title, verse, text)
- **Privacy system**: Public/private toggle with clear UI indicators
- Manual verse input with basic validation
- Personal devotion library with privacy filtering
- **Basic public blog feed** for non-authenticated users

### Phase 2: AI Integration (3-4 weeks)
- Gemini API integration for verse lookup
- Basic mood-based suggestions
- AI-assisted devotion writing
- Verse validation and auto-completion
- **Enhanced public feed** with featured devotions

### Phase 3: Enhanced UX (3-4 weeks)
- **Advanced privacy controls** (bulk editing, privacy audit trail)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Tag system and organization
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- **Community moderation system**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)
- PWA capabilities
- Advanced AI features (theme suggestions, writing improvement)
- Analytics and insights (privacy-respecting)
- **Community engagement features** (anonymous feedback, devotion impact stats)

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Daily active users, devotion creation rate
- **Retention**: 7-day and 30-day user return rates
- **Quality**: AI-generated content accuracy and user satisfaction
- **Growth**: User acquisition and sharing rates (if public features)

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Dependency**: Implement fallback for Gemini API outages
- **Content Quality**: Manual review system for public devotions
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from day one
- **User Privacy**: Clear data handling policies, especially for personal devotions

## Next Steps
1. Set up Laravel 12 + React development environment
2. Configure PostgreSQL database with initial migrations
3. Integrate shadcn/ui components for consistent design system
4. Implement basic authentication and user management
5. Create MVP devotion creation workflow
6. Begin Gemini API integration and testing

This comprehensive plan balances spiritual purpose with technical excellence, ensuring **Faithful** becomes a meaningful tool for Bible study and personal spiritual growth.
